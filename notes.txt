Deconstruct:


1. Characters -> Pacman and ghosts
   2 types ->  Playing (PC) & Non-Playing (NPC)

2. Defined goal -> Pacman (collect all food points)
                  Ludo (all 4 subplayers reach the house)

3. Rules -> Pacman - can't cross walls
                     when big food is eaten, ghosts become inactive
                     collect all points to win the game
                     if ghosts are touched when inactive, they die and ressurrect, and you get 200 points
                     if ghosts are touched when active, one chnace of pacman is taken away
                     chances-1
                     pacman moves in all directions but can't cross walls
                     
         -> balanced

4. Adaptive -> increasing the difficulty level of game based on certain conditions
            -> angry birds, pacman etc,.. difficulty increases with the increase in stage
            -> trex, subway surfers,.. in the sam e stage, difficulty is raised based on ceratin values like score or distance coveredifficulty

5. Chance vs Skill -> Chance: Pacman gets detected by the ghosts (unpredicted)
                      Skill: manouvering the pacman away from ghost 

6. Immediate feedback -> : Sounds, animation
                         : Scores, Ranks, Rewards
